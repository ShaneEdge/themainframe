👋 Hi, I’m Shane Edge

I’m a Computer Science student at SNHU (concentration in Software Engineering) with hands-on experience in Java, Python, C++, MongoDB, and Agile development practices. My focus is on building secure, user-friendly, and maintainable software that balances functionality with strong security standards.

🔐 Passionate about secure coding (OWASP tools, HTTPS, encryption, dependency management)

⚙️ Skilled in object-oriented design, testing (JUnit), and modular software development

📊 Experienced with Agile/Scrum practices, including user stories, sprint planning, and retrospectives

💡 Strong communicator — able to explain technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

🚀 Career goal: To apply my skills in software engineering and AI/ML to real-world challenges while continuing to grow as a developer

Portfolio Projects
Artemis Financial – Secure Software Development

Goal: Secure a web-based application by addressing vulnerabilities, ensuring safe key distribution, and enabling HTTPS for client data protection.

Key Contributions:

Implemented SHA-256 checksum verification to ensure integrity of distributed public keys.

Configured SSL with a self-signed certificate, enabling secure HTTPS communication.

Used OWASP Dependency-Check to identify and remediate outdated/vulnerable libraries.

Suppressed false positives effectively to generate accurate security reports.

Verified security and functionality with unit testing, REST endpoint checks, and re-scans after refactoring.

Tech Used: Java, Maven, JUnit, OWASP Dependency-Check, Java Keytool, SSL/HTTPS

themainframe – CS Advising System

Goal: Structure and manage course data for a computer science advising platform.

Key Contributions:

Designed and implemented efficient data structures to optimize performance.

Balanced time complexity and memory trade-offs when selecting structures.

Emphasized readability, maintainability, and modularity, improving long-term adaptability.

Tech Used: Java, Data Structures & Algorithms

DrivePass – Web-Based Payment & Sign-Up System

Goal: Create a web platform for new customer sign-ups and payments.

Key Contributions:

Designed a forgiving input system to prevent user frustration and improve UX.

Delivered clear explanations of technical details to non-technical stakeholders.

Created UML class diagrams (with opportunities for future refinement).

Focused on user-centric development, improving accessibility and usability.

Tech Used: Java, UML, Web Development Principles

Development Philosophy

User-Driven: Start from user needs and requirements, translate into actionable user stories.

Agile Approach: Work in sprints, integrate code frequently, and conduct sprint reviews/retrospectives.

Secure & Functional: Combine unit testing (JUnit) with secure coding practices (no hardcoded values, verified dependencies, HTTPS).

Teamwork: Communicate openly, support team members, and prioritize professionalism.
