In these projects, we tackled structuring and managing course data for a Computer Science advising system. I approached this by focusing on data organization, user accessibility, and efficient implementation. Understanding data structures was crucial, impacting efficiency and ease of implementation.

Roadblocks came up, especially in choosing the best data structure for each task. Overcoming these challenges involved weighing trade-offs and considering factors like time complexity and memory usage. This work expanded my software design approach by highlighting modularity and scalability's importance.

The project emphasized code readability, maintainability, and adaptability. It pushed for clear naming, comments, and modular design, ensuring the code was understandable, facilitating maintenance and future modifications.



The DrivePass project was a system that allowed the company DrivePass to have a web-based application that can sign up and accept payments from new customers.  
The thing I did best was explain it in layman's terms to the nontechnical members of DrivePass
If I could change one thing I did it would be the UML class diagram. I was less confident in that diagram than the rest of them. 
I designed a forgiving system that allowed for wrong inputs without requiring a restart of the program. 
I approach software from the user's point of view. This allows for the most enjoyable programs to use and makes it easier to find things to improve on.
