In these projects, we tackled structuring and managing course data for a Computer Science advising system. I approached this by focusing on data organization, user accessibility, and efficient implementation. Understanding data structures was crucial, impacting efficiency and ease of implementation.

Roadblocks came up, especially in choosing the best data structure for each task. Overcoming these challenges involved weighing trade-offs and considering factors like time complexity and memory usage. This work expanded my software design approach by highlighting modularity and scalability's importance.

The project emphasized code readability, maintainability, and adaptability. It pushed for clear naming, comments, and modular design, ensuring the code was understandable, facilitating maintenance and future modifications.
